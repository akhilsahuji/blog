**i endevour to build simple,performant and robust softwares.**

i believe in unix philosophy:

- small is beautiful.
- make each propgram do one thing well.
- build prototype as soon as possible.
- choose portability over efficienty.
- store numeric data in ascii files.
- use software leverage to your advantage.
- use shell script to increase leverage and portability.
- avoid captative user interface.
- make every program a filter.
